Portable OpenGL environment, no installations required. Just compile according to the instructions provided in the MinGW folder with the GLFW headers, GLFW libraries, glad headers and glad c file.

Glad folder was generated from http://glad.dav1d.de/ with the following settings.
Language: C/C++
Specification: OpenGL
API: Version 2.1
Profile: Compatability

I've removed several libraries and utilities that were originally in the MinGW folder to make it smaller.
